        <h2>Tips for Creating an Active Discussion Forum that Benefits Student Learning</h2>
        
 <ol class="matter"> 
     <br>
     <br>
     <li><strong>Think through your student learning goals.</strong></li>
     <p class="cent">Before choosing to use a discussion forum in your class, it is important to think through why a forum is the most appropriate tool to help you reach your student learning goals.</p>
     <li><strong>Build in motivation for students to participate.</strong></li>
     <p class="cent">Simply setting up a forum is not enough to get the conversation moving. Consider making participation part of the section or course grade, or devising an alternate method of motivating students to participate. For example, offering a forum as a way of preparing students for an assignment or exam may provide motivation to participate even when the forum doesn’t count as part of the students’ grade.</p>
     <li><strong>Make a plan for grading.</strong></li>
     <p class="cent">Be clear with students from the beginning about how and whether you will calculate forum use into students’ grades. Making forum participation part of the grade or offering it as an extra-credit option can provide needed motivation for students to participate. But grading a forum can also be confusing and time consuming; make sure that you devise a grading strategy ahead of time that is both clear to the students and realistic for you. Thank carefully about whether you will grade on quality or quantity of student posts or both. Devise a strategy for locating each student’s posts within the forum that will not take too long.</p>
     <li><strong>Choose a specific task and give explicit instructions.</strong></li>
     <p class="cent">If you tell your students to “discuss” class material on the forum, the discussion is likely to fall flat. In order to make the most of the forum, give students a specific task you would like them to complete in the forum, along with explicit instructions about your expectations for completing that task.</p>
     <li><strong>Share the learning goals with your students.</strong></li>
     <p class="cent">Communicate to students what you hope they will take away from the forum participation and why the forum is the best tool to help them accomplish the goals you have set out for them. Students are likely to be more invested in the activity if you communicate with them about why they are doing it in the first place.</p>
